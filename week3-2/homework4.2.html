			<h2>Spring</h2>
			<p>
			Here we are with the wild flowers rising from the earth,  
			looking to the casual eye as weeds until they bloom. 
			Who pays attention to their chaotic stems that twist in the joy of new life 
			until they wear colours as bold as any festival diva? 
			Then there they are in the air that becomes more welcoming each day, 
			a community of colours, a feast for butterfly and bee. 
			</p>
			</div>

			<div id="summer">
			<h2>summer </h2>
			<p>
			The flowers are a new masterpiece each day, changing the frameless scenery, 
			gazing upward at the ever-present sky; 
			they are the warmth of the land that give thanks to the warmth of the summer sun. 
			They are the rainbow that arises from earth and water, yet can be nothing without those golden rays. 
			Each day of these playful months will come in moments, the gift of the present, 
			lived in barefoot dances, wind-tousled hair, laughter and song... 
			the layers of winter left in some forgotten closet. 
			</p>
			</div>

			<div id="autumn">
			<h2>Autumn</h2>
			<p>
			The trees are laughing once more, dressed in their carnival clothes, 
			the gold and scarlet of the autumn days. 
			They play about the earthy hues of the branch and trunk, proud flags in any sky. 
			As they do I take in the freshly calm air with that hint of an earthly aroma, the fragrance of homeliness. 
			</p>
			</div>
			<div id="winter">
			<h2>Winter</h2>
			<p>
			The wintry sun is the brightness of the day, 
			taking centre stage as the blooms of the summertime become a part of the soil. 
			The sunshine and cold, the sparkle and the ice, somehow warm even when the north wind bites. 
			There will be days I wish to stay in the warm, to observe from a duvet, 
			fingers wrapped snuggly around some cocoa... 
			yet somedays the winter takes my hand and shows me its beauty, that in truth, 
			 it is but the dawn of spring.
